&lt;p&gt;Declare: While paving my way towards my neverland, I don't mind being alone. I won't return to advertise and persuade either. Because the trace I left is not meant to guide, it is to inspire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this starts with a stream of morning thoughts posted on Twitter, after reading a post about the potential of LPR (loan premier rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure if I understand it correctly. LPR makes China sounds like national capitalism. It is definitely not the reflection of the free market. But this might work out the best when the information barrier and decision skill of the state is far advanced than the people, and most of the corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of cause, it could be the consequence, and source of rent-seeking, which officially begins as let some be rich first, and let the early rich help the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think any gov can do better than PRC. Such policies can only work in this rare case, where one party can hold its principles consistent most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is inspiring for anyone to wonder how the first awake ones should treat the rest. Since we fancy harmony, I hope that we will, when the time comes that the rest are also awakened, the ego of the elites will not feel hurt not to take advantage of the so-then-called historical market power and become the blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That moment could be the rise of an AI overload, which efficiently negotiating the supply/demand to maximize resource distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But computationally, an agency at that capability is much more difficult to build than multiple at a lower level. When multiple AI overloads exist, will that world fancy equal right? Will they adopt the free market of power supply, network bandwidth, and computation resource? Unless there is shared memory or more that I don't have the imagination about, it will be just another Darwinism world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world for that type of intelligence will be no longer limited to the earth ecosystem. Scale-out or scale-up are both not radical solutions. It is only a delay of the zero-sum/limited resource conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current issue is that, as the entropy increases regardless of any ideologies, many awaken-but-not-wise-enough are losing faith. We haven’t tried enough and there are more means than possible to be explored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this preference-less world that is full of possibilities, what is the loss of annihilation, when one surely know, support, and appreciate the existence of others? The odds of possibilities are never in favor of one, and it is the choice to be a different one and embrace the many that matters. We are no better compared to the wise ancestors in this kind of spiritual realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrogance built upon science/technology development is the biggest obstruct. Straits is the gate. We need another Renaissance to fairly position the logical reasoning behind, back to the spotlight of civilization advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance inductive and deductive reasoning, while collaborating on building a shared knowledge base until more enlightened. That is what I forged into my life mission, by the means of crafting a collaborative society, MindWave, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhausted but sprinkling with the joy of better storytelling skills, to express, to be heard and to be enlightened. All words are mine, biased by the possibility I experienced and expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I recon the younger me set the goal as to see the world of all possibility is what sets the tone. X beyond the mountains, Y through the seas, Z to the stars.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughts on Autonumous driving and Humanity</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/thoughts-on-autonumous-driving-and-humanity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2019-09-25:/thoughts-on-autonumous-driving-and-humanity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When autonomous driving cars start to reach the critical mass, AV algorithms will start to turn from defensive into aggressive, slowly outpacing human drivers, and then rapidly racing over AV algorithms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because defensive algorithms are conservative. One can develop a simple AV algorithm and it will be safe when other cars with advanced algorithms will avoid putting each other in danger. It is a matter of time for AVs to become more aggressive to maximize the benefits of road priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world with only edge computing, if there is no self-regulation, the road will become the new battlefield of a dystopian world, for AV companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it is a debate about human governance or machine governance. The latter will never win unless we trust machines even when we don’t understand why they make the decision, which is only one lawsuit away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought it will be machine-assisted human governance. But it won’t take long for machines to take over, as the nature of the free market is a Darwinian world evolving towards resource efficiency (entropy). It is more likely to be human-assisted machine governance until we are doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AV can walk away from court without human reasoning-able causes in any case. It is a matter of belief that we’ve given away our right to justification. Not necessary a bad ending, but we should be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because computation never has any moral goals and the god of possibility has no preference. The only reason machine governance becomes human-friendly is by crafting the human principles and human values into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing that, we are basically digitalizing ourselves or manufacturing cyber humans. But because it is so hard for us to collaborate within ourselves now, I don't believe it will be easier at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes more than one prophet to make the world awake, and it takes more to raise and make changes matter. Are you, willing to be Prometheus? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix ourselves is the only way to fix the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Manifesto</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/manifesto.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-03-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2019-03-29:/manifesto.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/domijin/LibertyEarth"&gt;The Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Open Meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Development&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Peer Review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jury Decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid Democracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can make the shape, but it is all that can fill the gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative Society&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest achievement and challenge for humans is how to collaborate better. It could be broken down into two tasks, 1. how to communicate better (effective &amp;amp; efficient); 2. how to organize better (optimized team &amp;amp; motivating). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to product-market fit, there is a lot of engineering work to be done and an even greater challenge to recruit and manage a team to execute. Technologies are only byproducts and tools. It is how everyone is valued and matched to take ownership to develop that really strikes. That’s what put my two pieces of challenges together to help people collaborate better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about social identity and job market, resumes and social media always come to our minds. But these are projections that don’t fully nor correctly reveal our personalities, knowledge bases, or abilities. How could that result in the most optimized team formation and function? It becomes natural to develop solutions like MindWave to help people communicate, and help understand communication while eventually understanding people as well. Of course, it depends a lot on the technologies like signal processing, ASR, NLP, knowledge graph, cloud services as well as adoptions for different domains and scenarios. But it is how people communicate their thoughts and how people organize to deliver the biggest assets of human civilization. With the service and tools to understand how people communicate, it becomes practical to effectively evaluate the contribution and distribute the ownership accordingly. Mild management or no management will ever be needed if collective decisions become an obligation as well as a reward corresponding to the dynamic credibility and ownership, which could be realized with a blockchain design of liquid democracy and decentralized social credit system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As until now, I feel somewhat comfortable and satisfied to fully push forward with this vision to empower people to collaborate better. The first step of collaboration is always to communicate (openly) and embrace changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this somehow resonates with you, please step up to learn about &lt;a href="https://github.com/domijin/LibertyEarth/blob/master/Execution.md"&gt;how to get invovled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;协作社会&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我现在认识到我真正要达成的是促进人类更好的协作。其中的挑战包括
- 促进有效的沟通，
- 优化和激励管理。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;无论是通过硬件产品帮助会议记录，还是SaaS服务促进办公自动化，又或者是通过写关于未来的科幻故事。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当然，在切入市场的时候，会有很多的工程任务。更大的困难还在于招募和管理一个团队。这种时候，技术只是工具和资产。真正重要的是让团队各尽其能，默契一致。这也是我为何将促进人类更好的协作，细化为两个方面。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;当我们讨论社会身份和就业市场的时候，通常考虑的是简历和互联网社交。然而这些只是我们个性，知识以及能力的一个缩影，甚至都算不上准确。这种情况下，组建和实现最佳的团队就成了困难。MindWave自然变成为了最自然的解决的方案。通过帮助人们更好的沟通，并理解沟通，也能最终对沟通的人有更好的画像。当然了，这个项目需要依赖各种技术，比如信号处理，语音识别，语义理解，知识图谱，云服务以及不同领域和场景的定制化。但正是交流和组织背后展现的思维和合作才是人类文明最大的财富。有了促进人类沟通的服务和工具，通过量化评估各人的贡献实现匹配的分配才变得可能。当集体决策与个人的义务和分配所得相对应的时候，人们自然地会以其社会信用和责任理性的参与集体决策。这样的管理机制可以通过基于区块链的去中心化社会信用体系以及流动民主来实现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;意识到了这些，我现在才觉得有足够的思考底气去全面推进这个促成人类更好协作的理念。而协作的第一步永远是开诚布公地去交流和拥抱异见。所以我很期待你的反馈。我目前已经积累了一些人脉但是依然需要更多的帮助去实现之后的步骤。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果你恰好也有这样的理想，我非常期待能与你一起成长和实现。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Response to &lt;a href="http://996.icu"&gt;996&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你们需要的是更多“站着挣钱”的公司。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;公司是大家剩余价值的沉淀，分配制度没有变革的情况下，是无法调和阶级矛盾的。持股无非只是努力从被剥削者成为剥削者而已。要radical的解决这种矛盾，就需要有新的协作机制。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;人类有天然的生理限制，包括 1. 有限的主意力（信息IO） 2. 有限的思维能力（信息processing）。先不提衰老，这些限制是以生物进化作为时标。而各领域技术创新，是与信息分享（联通率）和网络规模（人口）成正比，是社会发展作为时标。这两者的时标差异必然导致互联网信息爆炸，乃至技术焦虑。要避免这种焦虑，又得回到分配模式的变革以及用新技术接触对技能的依赖。AI的时代，我们需要的是一场文艺复新，回归人本主义。摆脱技能和分配对劳动力的束缚，进一步解放创新能力和协作规模去实现进一步的生产发展。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我正在力图解决这一挑战，通过技术实现 1. 有效全面的沟通 2. 优化和激励管理。&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Competitive Advantage vs Absolute Advantage</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/competitive-advantage-vs-absolute-advantage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-10T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-01-10T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2019-01-10:/competitive-advantage-vs-absolute-advantage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is hard to fully evaluate a person.

The most conventional way is the lookup the education history and career experience from resume. It provides a quick reference of the ability based on the established institutional reputation. This efficient but coarse filter to position a new candidate, needs additional validation to be followed to fine grain one’s knowledge abundance and skill level. This is the epistemology in recruitment field. The fitness is a measurement of competitive advantage at that moment. The dynamics of potential realization and future achievement is still mystery and impractical to incorporate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In social networking, connections become the endorsement of one’s personality, sociological status, economical ability and political attitude. While we cherish the trustability built upon such underwriting connections, we take the detail as privacy. The psychological comfort cannot be fulfilled with unconditional transparency. The only motivation to withdraw one’s conservation on that is to initiate a new connection, or “relation of production”. In a perfect world, not only is everyone born free and equal, but also has the same subjectivity and initiative. We cannot deny the efficiency promoted by scale effect and deep domain expertise, where division of labour naturally differentiates the population, along with the geographically and politically affected globalization. The relation of production shapes the distribution of production and beyond with free market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the understanding and toolsets advance, things may change and should be. With machinery, we overcome the productivity bias induced by biological difference from age, sex or physiological condition. With information and communication technology, we reduce the informative decision making bias, regardless of the geographic difference on cultural awareness, development status, or knowledge access. But the further development in capitalism encourages the competitive advantage rather than the “absolute advantage” of a personal, which values more on bolder knowledge span, creativity and enthusiasm. In the competitive world, rule of limited-sum game optimizes an individual to fit into a discriminative society. Privacy inequality is thus a reflection of the sociological bias. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one glance, it seems that continue the development to increase the total sum is the silver bullet. I’d only point out the nature limit of material and energy resources won’t be easily lifted at foreseeable future. Space technology and fundamental physics will eventually be the bottleneck. But at the moment, it is the mode of distribution. There is enough food to end hunger and there is more plastic than needed. Similar to the information bias in imperfect market, the evaluation bias to monetize the ability of a person causes the inequality. It is far too early to claim any solution. But machine learning and artificial intelligence is reducing the disorder of market with informative decisions followed by rational quantitative analysis under econometrics. Heterogeneous supply and perfect information may not be a dream in the future of decentralized democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>White paper - A future imaged</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/white-paper-a-future-imaged.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-11-27T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2018-11-27:/white-paper-a-future-imaged.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Uncapped productivity for material abundance. Socks for example&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-demand: when land in airport, pick up new socks for duration of the trip, drop off socks when return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Material efficiency: socks are made with dissolving fibers, produce on-demand, recycle as needed (like 3D printing &amp;amp; material recycle), less shipping/packaging cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy efficiency: logistic/inventory cost is building up, compared to the scale effect from division of labor &amp;amp; mass production efficiency, under global distribution; made in China is getting more expensive, and so it will be for made in any other emerging market; Amazon will be threaten when new retail (self-service store &amp;amp; self-delivery) + local supply made cheaper with on-demand manufacturing. I.E. socks printed at airport, usb chargers re-engineer/recycle/share, old clothes redesign/recycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customization: design, style, taste is the reflection of personality. For socks under the new manufacturing, consumers shop design/style in e-marketplace, feed their biometrics to let AI adjust to fit, modify color/material, and send to local hub for print/assemble/“bake” using 3D printing, robotic arms, biological engineering or any other techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ownership rethink&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefit of privacy: we can’t share socks or undies for hygiene reasons, but more for psychological reasons, which can be solved with proper sterilization and psychological “placebos”. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefit of convenience: my primary reason for having a car is the trunk space, to store things that feel needed but not often used. It may be replaced with modularized self-walking luggage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affordability: we rent, when the cost of ownership is too high for the usage. But ownership comes with responsibility. We provide space, care and proper treatment for pets. Stuffs we own, will also occupy space, need regular care and proper disposal. Otherwise, the space, material and energy are wasted. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current manufacturing is not energy/material friendly. A lot of resources are dissipated/wasted in logistics: inventory, shipping, packaging. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can’t find/afford things exactly as we want in the current manufacturing model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency of logistics come with huge delivery cost. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical manufacturing hub that feed on basic materials, produce on-demand, recycle as needed, with marketplace for designs can maximize the energy utilization and ensure material abundance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Socio-economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity supplies distribution. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[old age] Autarky, self-sufficient production with limited exchange and community market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[past] Electricity lifts off labor-bias with machinery, labor cost per production drops and productivity blooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[now] ICT lifts off information-bias with internet, market grows globally and circulation efficiency leaps with e-commerce, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[future] AGI will lift off skill-bias, domain knowledge and expertise will be less dependent to produce better products and services. Any nurse with medical AI can perform high-quality diagnosis and treatment plans. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution shapes the socio-economy.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[old age] Reputation. Culture and traditions are conventional agreements to regulate individual with the tribe, community or society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[past] Power. Darwin society with expiration, monopoly and crime leads to slavery, militarism, imperialism, Fascist. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[now] Network. As peaces continue, social classes consolidates, so it is with wealth distribution. Capitalism leaves less chances for the resourceless families. It compliments the elites in Wall Street and Silicon Valley but many feel anxious about the fast-changing job market and heating threats from AI powered automations. That’s how I interpret the political shifts due to the rising voice from the worried/underappreciated workers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[future] Human first, AI is mimic of human intelligence and the unprecedented computational ability should aim to enhance human. Let AGI be good at information processing and empower human to take responsibility of moral consideration, decision making, medical result delivery, providing humanize service and creativity. Follow this direction, individuals will no longer be bounded with single career/job function, to accumulate competitive advantage for financial reward. Income differences will also decrease, as personal domain knowledge and expertise cannot compete with AGI. Equality will detour individual’s interest to creativity, personal development and social good. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City and community&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Declare&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The diverse possibility is the beauty of future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One man’s expectation can’t and won’t satisfy all. But such imaged future is what my technical roadmap can leads to. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community Management &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every social transaction (behavior) satisfies the consented social contract adds personal credibility on his social credit. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: when the community agrees on sterilizing all house cats. C tells D that he feels lazy to sterilize his cat and it won’t matter. AGI notices the violation of consented social contract and lower C’s social credit correspondingly to reflect his credibility. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The math behind: enforcement is hard/costly, and legislation is dangerous with central authority. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average social credit profile of the members represents the credibility of the community, which goes up to higher level of communities like city, state, continent, planet and more. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike black mirror -  the future of social media, the enforcement is AGI automated to remove human bias. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every proposed change of social contract in the community will be voted and adopted automatically, using voice based human-information-interface. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like-minded people gather to form community, guided by democratically voted social contracts, which are registered as smart contracts on community blockchains. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: A tells B that they should sterilize house cats and B agrees to advocate the policy to community. Wearable device with AGI automatically recognize and draft a proposal to the community. A&amp;amp;B discusses about the detail and let AGI make a campaign. Members who see the campaign may express their options, which will be collected and counted. Soon, AGI receives enough feedback and make the agreement as official social contract. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The math behind: AGI can automate and decentralize legislation processes with transparency and efficiency; it is easier to understand legislation in physical world but easier to adopt in virtual world with smart contract on blockchain; one approach is to establish a decentralized identity system to evaluate individual’s social credit from TOC histories. Anyhow, a society with trust is a species will last. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summarize&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hierarchical manufacturing hub for material supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open government powered by AGI to ensure enforcement efficiency and transparency&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social contract on blockchain for legislation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMO credit system for personal credibility&lt;/li&gt;

But I'm glad to share with any like-minded person, who doesn't "live the moment", who longs for the future, who cares about humanity, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always anxious, about people’s lack of first principle thinking, the reckless to the environmental and sociological consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity and Human Intelligence are beautiful myth, that lifts homo species off the biological evolution track, into the fast track of sociological evolution. We advance so fast in science, technology and social organization in the scope of earth history, which drains the nature resources exponentially. From animal power, to chemical power, to nuclear power, the ability of energy utilization marks our level of civilization. The increase of productivity, also shifts the political landscape by socio-economy effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new era of ICT and AGI, a new scope, computation consumption per person, may rise as a new indicator to better segment our development stage. Despite the excitement, in front we face global warming and the subsequent natural disaster, unintended simplification of ecosystem and subsequent fatal plague due to globalization, foreseeable energy crisis &amp;amp; waste cycling &amp;amp; astronomical events, not even to mention the growing inequality in wealth distribution &amp;amp; jobless &amp;amp; fear of jobless &amp;amp; evil AI...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selfishly, I don’t want to live in such a future, nor for my future generations. Nuclear fusion, AGI can power the productivity and economic growth further more, but not if the humanity fall due to the sociological consequences. That’s what puzzles me over the years. I have decided to develop a few approaches in hope to solve that. I haven’t lived a comfortable moment yet, as a second born from a farmer family in China, but I won’t end with a decent job for comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely would like your advice, on how should I validate my approaches, find resources to develop and make efforts to solve, or inspire more to work on a solution. I’d love to discuss and share my approaches in detail, which may not be fit in one plain email for all the hypothesis, experiment design, business plan, R&amp;amp;D roadmap, technical dependencies, potential obstacles and sociological consequences I’ve pictured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find more about me at domij.info, and really look forward to meeting you in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Decentralize social credit + identification system</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/decentralize-social-credit-identification-system.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2018-10-28:/decentralize-social-credit-identification-system.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This idea has been in my mind for a while.

I'm worried about the potential consequence that may go north if carried out in the wrong hand. But similar things are happening already and &lt;code&gt;life always find its way&lt;/code&gt;. We won't make progress without bearing risks. And I hold faith in collective humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modularized Terms and Conditions that makes legal consents clear and easy, just like grant permission for mobile apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's new&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our attention is limited and precious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NLP can break down page-long legal bindings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consent to one agreement at need is easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universal consents can be done OAFA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valued attention will help iterate agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WE build on social contracts and universal value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MVP approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crawl Terms &amp;amp; Conditions, Privacy Policies, User Agreements over the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clean and unify data format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train NLP model on collected data plus legal documents ad-hoc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;topic model each sentence/paragraph for all the files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;term/topic weight based on similarity/quote or page-ranking methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generate first version of modularized terms and conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use case example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free dev API for website/software/service developers to quote and assemble their initial legal documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free user API for consents management and authorization management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;paid underwriting service for any potential cost in litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smart contract of user-consent-provider on blockchain to make it decentralized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decentralization will make terms and conditions more standardized. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unique identification based on time-stamped consent history built upon blockchain. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;digitize paper-based legal system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regulate virtual behavior of any entity with the social impact of an universal identification system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legislation made easy with true votes backed by decentralized social credit system, from personal social credit, to community social credit, regional social credit and more. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rebuild democracy with the spirit of social contract based on each citizen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the same interest, or would like to take it off with some sustainable business plan only for practical reason, I'm here to share my 2 cents. At the moment, I will be taking responsibility of my share holders on a career to enhance humanity with technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Pitch words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constitution of unites states is one of the most inspiring achievements in human civilization, especially at this decisive moment of history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m bringing an approach towards decentralized democracy to help re-craft social contracts (pointed out by Jean Rousseau) that shape the modern society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to launch a NGO project for decentralized democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by building a system that provides standard/modular terms and conditions for suppliers/ dev teams to quote and manage users’ consents. So that user only need to read and consent new additional terms at need and dev teams can save effort on legal concern. Just like permission to photos is only required when you want to send a picture in the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, the unique time-stamped user consents in our system can become an identity that is hard to compromise. It will be extended into physical world for any agreement, marriage vow, or security check to transform ethical bonding into a measurable social contract. In which, will evolve and expand to be community rules, cultural traditions, national constitution and universal value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will demonstrate how to build this system with natural language processing plus blockchain techniques, with features like “learning” curve and Page ranking to let the community to balance and involve in the legislation of a decentralized social credit system, which I hope will be a Renaissance of the United States constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Launch now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build something people want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do things that don’t scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the 90 / 10 solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find 10-100 customers who love your product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All startups are badly broken at some point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write code – talk to users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It’s not your money”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth is the result of a great product not the precursor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuation is not equal to success or even probability of success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid long negotiated deals with big customers if you can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid big company corporate development queries – they will only waste time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid conferences unless they are the best way to get customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-product market fit – do things that don’t scale: remain small/nimble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founder relationships matter more than you think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes you need to fire your customers (they might be killing you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore your competitors, you will more likely die of suicide than murder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most companies don’t die because they run out of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be nice! Or at least don’t be a jerk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get sleep and exercise – take care of yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"&gt;Do Things That Don't Scale&lt;/a&gt;, Paul
- recruit users manually
- weekly growth rate
- insanely attention to users
- pull a Meraki: manually manufacture 
- launch doesn't matter
- Partnerships too usually don't work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the best case, both components of the vector contribute to your company's DNA: the unscalable things you have to do to get started are not merely a necessary evil, but change the company permanently for the better. If you have to be aggressive about user acquisition when you're small, you'll probably still be aggressive when you're big. If you have to manufacture your own hardware, or use your software on users' behalf, you'll learn things you couldn't have learned otherwise. And most importantly, if you have to work hard to delight users when you only have a handful of them, you'll keep doing it when you have a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Make something people want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about being a woman. &lt;code&gt;in our case: don't underestimate woman&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure your growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know if you’re default alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep expenses low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fund-raising gets harder. Series A investors are looking for performance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start by making something people actually want, focus on making users happy, make sure you have a good growth rate and don’t over-hire, you’ll be in a very happy position. You will be master of your own fate in a way that very few people ever get to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be distracted on these
- “Grabbing coffee” with investors
- Talking with potential acquires
- Networking
- Recruiting boards of advisors
- Doing a “partnership,” thinking it will get you more users
- Spending time on PR before you have made something people want
- Arguing on social media
- Going to conferences
- Worrying about being a woman in tech&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ask how should I be spending my time: product and customer satisfaction in my case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a key metric to track and focus exclusively on making that metric grow: average use time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose the activity that you believe will directly result in increased growth of your chosen metric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple metric: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((b * d) / c\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(b\)&lt;/span&gt; tells you how many of your users, current or new, will be impacted by a new feature, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt; describes how important that feature will be to the average user, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(c\)&lt;/span&gt; gives you how hard it is to build the feature. Just like MVP for each phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;product market fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;growth rate of 10% per week for several weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how much to raise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best: raise once and for all, avoid more than 25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;second: follow-on round&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create multiple plans assuming different amounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set an essential amount to succeed, aim for faster grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many months of operation&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$15k per month for an engineer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18 month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are raising for N months (usually 12-18) and will thus need $X, where X will usually be between $500k and $1.5 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing options: First comes a seed round, then a Series A, then a Series B, then a Series C, and so on to acquisition or IPO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most seed rounds, at least in Silicon Valley, are now structured as either convertible debt or simple agreements for future equity (safes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convertible Debt: loan with interest rate + maturity date&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it converts to equity (thus, “convertible”) when the company does an equity financing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;usually have a “Cap” or “Target Valuation” and / or a discount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Cap is the maximum effective valuation that the owner of the note will pay, regardless of the valuation of the round in which the note converts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a discount defines a lower effective valuation via a percentage off the round valuation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convertible debt may be called at maturity, at which time it must be repaid with earned interest, although investors are often willing to extend the maturity dates on notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A safe acts like convertible debt without the interest rate, maturity, and repayment requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/"&gt;safe primer&lt;/a&gt; by YC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting a valuation for your company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hire a lawyer when planning to issue equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dilution based on new equity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity incentive plans (option pools), liquidation preferences, anti-dilution rights, protective provisions, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always best to use well-known financing documents like YC’s safe. These documents are well understood by the investor community, and have been drafted to be fair, yet founder friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valuation&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;let the market set your price and to find an investor to set the price or cap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more investor interest your company generates, the higher your value will trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not to over-optimize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a valuation with which you are comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors: Angels &amp;amp; VC&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;angels are amateurs and VCs are pros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faster and more mature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents needed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your company / Logo / Tag Line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Vision – Your most expansive take on why your new company exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Problem – What are you solving for the customer–where is their pain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Customer – Who are they and perhaps how will you reach them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Solution – What you have created and why now is the right time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The (huge) Market you are addressing – Total Available Market (TAM) &amp;gt;$1B if possible. Include the most persuasive evidence you have that this is real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Landscape – including competition, macro trends, etc. Is there any insight you have that others do not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Traction – list key stats / plans for scaling and future customer acquisition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business model – how users translate to revenue. Actuals, plans, hopes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team – who you are, where you come from and why you have what it takes to succeed. Pics and bios okay. Specify roles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary – 3-5 key takeaways (market size, key product insight, traction)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundraising – Include what you have already raised and what you are planning to raise now. Any financial projections may go here as well. You can optionally include a summary product roadmap (6 quarters max) indicating what an investment buys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundraising Rules to Follow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get fundraising over as soon as possible, and get back to building your product and company, but also…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t stop raising money too soon. If fundraising is difficult, keep fighting and stay alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When raising, be “greedy”: breadth-first search weighted by expected value 2. This means talk to as many people as you can, prioritizing the ones that are likely to close.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once someone says yes, don’t delay. Get docs signed and the money in the bank as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always hustle for leads. If you are the hottest deal of the hour, that’s great, but everyone else needs to work like crazy to get angels and other venture investors interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never screw anyone over. Hold yourself and others on your team to the highest ethical standards. The Valley is a very small place, and a bad reputation is difficult to repair. Play it straight and you will never regret it. You’ll feel better for it, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors have a lot of different ways to say no. The hardest thing for an entrepreneur is understanding when they are being turned down and being okay with it. PG likes to say, “If the soda is empty, stop making that awful sucking sound with the straw.” But remember that they might be a “yes” another time, so part on the best possible terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a style that fits you and your company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay organized. Co-founders should split tasks where possible. If necessary, use software like Asana to keep track of deals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a thick skin but strike the right balance between confidence and humility. And never be arrogant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DON’T:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be dishonest in any way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be arrogant or unfriendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be overly aggressive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seem indecisive – although it is okay to say you don’t know yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk so much they cannot get a word in edgewise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be slow to follow-up or close a deal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break an agreement, verbal or written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create detailed financials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use ridiculous / silly market size numbers without clear justification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claim you know something that you don’t or be afraid to say you don’t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend time on the obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get caught up in unimportant minutiae – don’t let the meeting get away from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for an NDA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to play investors off each other when you are not a fundraising ninja&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to negotiate in real-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-optimize your valuation or worry too much about dilution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a “No” personally&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy for People Who Want to be Founders&lt;/strong&gt;
Your initial goal is to accumulate the prerequisites to being a founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify potential teammates you can work with who have the required technical skills to help you build your MVP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out the financial plan. I.e. Do you have enough money in savings, do you have friends/family who can provide seed investment, can you bootstrap, can you reduce your spending and save enough give yourself 6-12 months to work on your idea?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify a problem that you and your potential teammates are passionate about solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The least important (but still required) is having an idea on how of how to solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;sign the purchase agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;83 (b)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vesting, for the long haul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seed round: conversion notes, safes, no voting rights, cap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;board seats: choose wisely, must add value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adviser: investor is de facto adviser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro-rata rights: rights to maintain percentage ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information right: monthly update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;company expenses&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate and spend wisely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bookkeeping the documents for tax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;founder employment&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;set-up payroll service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;worker's compensation insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay salaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimum wage: $2000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hiring employees&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;working right in US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;employee: responsible for taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contractor: consulting contract, 1099, not responsible for taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IP assignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fire employees&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fire quickly and professionally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communicate clearly: we're letting you go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pay the wage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repurchase unvested stocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legitimacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPA: tax return
Lawyers: use standard forms first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adoracheung.com/technical-co-founder"&gt;technical co-founder&lt;/a&gt; Adora&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a firm offer. If you don’t have money for salary and/or that person has no outside commitments requiring salary, then propose 50/50 equity split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, when you identify the right person. Instead of pitching them directly your idea. Brainstorm ideas with that person so it evolves with the both of you. This will be a good start to a hopefully lasting relationship of building together.&lt;/p&gt;

CV &amp;amp; Lidar are comp-expensive, not to mention the scheduling that scale with N^2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we add the complexity of delay control, the system will be chaotic like the failure of jurassic park. Plus, any malfunction in the system will probably be a costly issue that no society can afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's only used in out-of-city transportation, then bullet train and @hyperloop will be more appealing. Of course, I enjoy the flexible #trunk space. What if we can modularize that and make it easy to plug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really want to sell here is that, road is only 2 dimensional space that has limited capacity. We should utilize the airspace! I'm not talking about #FlyingCars by @TerrafugiaInc or #JetPack. They will fall and fail. And that will scare the world like #Concorde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the computation scale will be no less than self-driving cars. #KardashevScale is a measure of civilization's level of technological advancement based on energy usage. We should add sub scales based on the computation usage per person. @PeterDiamandis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Back to airspace usage, we can think in these directions, 1. separate power unit and passenger space, 2. use guided rails for power unit (top-down self-drive system), 3. let passenger capsule fly like a glider towed by the power unit. @elonmusk #FutureTransportation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits are, 1. safer, glider can crash land and there is also a string to hang on; 2. rail for power unit is cheap to build and maintain (the weight load will be offset by lifting); 3. modularize capsules are simple and cheap with no complex control system needed; 4. we won't need to get down to ground anymore, only way towards billion-population city built vertically; 5. easy to adopt in #SpaceSettlement, you may need this on the #MarsColony, @elonmusk; 6. inspirational and worthy to pass on to the future generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? The scale will be like 10 FLOPD (flops per day) avg before calculator invented, 10^2 FLOPD before transistors invented, then it goes viral based on Moore's law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From radio/DVD, to gaming console/computers, until smartphone with cloud service, our consumption of computational power is increasing exponentially, even faster than Moore's law with so many #SaaS and even #HaaS, hardware as a service like what we do in MindWave.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Birth of MindWave X</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/birth-of-mindwave-x.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-10-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2018-10-13:/birth-of-mindwave-x.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mindwave.business"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/MindWaveX.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many young entrepreneurs, Y Combinator is the dream place to launch startups. I didn't know anything, not the startup schools, not the Hacker News, not the Office Hours, not the YC partners. I signed up the YC Hack 2018 just like a Texan town boy, without too many thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things start to heat up when I joined the Slack, where like-minds start to pitch their ideas and put up their profiles. So I did the same thing and hoping to get some connections with the silicon valley people. Nothing much happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/04/2018, it was a normal day in Texas, hot and sunny, when I drove from Brownsville to Austin for a flight to San Jose. The 24 hour journey is a mind-blower. I met with these two Denmark cowboys, who hacked a way to store data on blockchain with 5% of the normal gas fee. There are so many flaws in many of the picked projects but all those teams did very impressive delivery of some products or services. There is no cash award except for an interview with YC and some office hour, which I realized later on that it is exactly what a successful company needs, a good team with execution skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't learn it that night and my ego is really somewhat annoying to others. But I also didn't stick to my plan and make it a go, as I feel tired of being the idea source plus the doer. There is no easy path as hitchhiking and everything I want have to be earned by own effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is never late to take the lesson and here I am, as the founder of &lt;a href="https://mindwave.business"&gt;MindWave&lt;/a&gt; after one week. The initial plot is interestingly simple and attractive so that many have approached me to carry it on. 
&lt;!-- But until later that I realize that none of them really understand the potential and how to properly do it right.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- There is some magic from my co-founder that even though I'm unhappy that I have to explain everything from technical details to vision map, he pushed me to continue and stick on. I have never speak out so much that everything I want to do starts to shape and sound.  --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no other moment that cheers me up so much to work continuously with full passion and inspiration. Every step makes it closer to real and there is just no foreseeable limit of this journey that will drain my creativity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I present, Mind Wave, a company that delivers the best of assistance to human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that &lt;strong&gt;Human Intelligence should come first&lt;/strong&gt;. As human is still more intelligent and AI should aim to enhance that. AI is the new electricity but we will be the Renaissance of the revolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Request for Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At MindWave, we seek to build an approach to understand the most intuitive and direct reflection of human intelligence, speech and conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing Hardware as a Service, we will act as the upstream of human-internet interface that not only enhance your communication skills but also unprecedented add-on values to access, interact and understand informations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From augmented intelligence, to artificial intelligence, MindWave will transform the world to rethink about data, device and intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a Y Combinator project, launching our first prototype by the end of October, with mapped out path towards marketing, Research and development with continuous revenue generation plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for Partnerships that can share our vision and help expedite our mission towards the Tomorrowland of Human Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/thoughts-on-artificial-intelligence-and-natural-language-processing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-09-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2018-09-19:/thoughts-on-artificial-intelligence-and-natural-language-processing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My experience of AI/NLP research and development is limited compared to HPC and data analysis.

During my summer intern as R&amp;amp;D in NLP/query understanding, I studied linguistics and implemented the stoke and order into Chinese NLP, based on its nature as a logographic system. Time will reveal that even though computer programming is highly based on English, AI/NLP may work better in a different language system, which will have the elegant simplicity of mathematics and abundant expressiveness in Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to practice, I have been studying word embeddings like word2vec, and then utilize them for specific linguistic tasks like NER/POS with supervised LSTM + CRF model, or unsupervised models for topic modeling, text summary, etc. From my bilingual background, I realize that knowledge base could be further validated or expanded by multi-languages. I am also interested in the similarity between state-space model and neural network model. Despite the magic non-linearity from activation function, both are seeking optimal/equilibrium with updating techniques based on gradient (and chain rule). The advance of AI/NLP is thus mainly the result of Higher Performance Computing. Leapfrog, MCMC, gradient descent, SGD, batch updating or so are still some compromise regarding to high dimensional parameter space iteration, given the ever-increasing computation power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, data quality is very important at the moment and it's the cornerstone for commercial products, depending on/deciding the use case and market focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my 2 cents about AI/NLP. I also have some thoughts on data acquisition and business model waiting to develop. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="articles"></category></entry><entry><title>Quickguide to start a static website with Pelican</title><link href="http://dxj4360.uta.cloud/quickguide-to-start-a-static-website-with-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-09-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Dongming Jin</name></author><id>tag:dxj4360.uta.cloud,2018-09-01:/quickguide-to-start-a-static-website-with-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many options to build a website.

&lt;li&gt;Resources&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pelicanthemes.com/"&gt;Themes gallery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="git@github.com:Parbhat/pelican-blue.git"&gt;pelican blue&lt;/a&gt;: the one I used here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: for many themes, the default index is defined as the list of blog articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy a theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; the theme folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;, add &lt;code&gt;THEME = "path/to/theme"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or use flag when build a project, &lt;code&gt;pelican -t ~/pelican-themes/theme-name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic structure of a theme folder is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
├── static
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── pygments.css
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── images
│   │   └── icons
│   └── js
│       └── comments.js
└── templates
    ├── archives.html
    └── ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To customize or build a theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modify or create new &lt;code&gt;css, js&lt;/code&gt; files and &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; templates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pelican-themes -i {your_theme_name}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="setup"&gt; Setups &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete setting list can be found at &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/settings.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Many of which are not needed. Here I covered some setups for this website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; file explained: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;FTP: &lt;code&gt;make ftp_upload&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Important Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OS X has discontinued the support of PPTP since 2016. PPTP VPN is not secure as brute force attack tool exists to decrypt traffic over the VPN tunnel. The most practical advice is to move on to IPSec or SSL VPN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pricey future. High cost of R&amp;amp;D, city reconstruction and potential failure damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may consider about guided glider with modular on a rail. At least it won’t crash with power failure and when it crashes, no exploration or second damage imposed. Or just us AI to detach and glide to land. Still keeping the benefit of high volume traffic in air and city can then be built vertically with higher population density, which in turn is the use case of such transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good point to make a public checkpoint public for an idea I have thought of and researched on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find the right the viscosity of the liquid: the liquid should response to acceleration in certain way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the right shape of the inner ring: circular, oval, or a better functioning shape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design: is it necessary to have 4 pieces? Maybe this is designed to add on normal glasses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOV coverage: optimize the shape and size to set a standard for flexible design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my knock-off design to reverse engineering the &lt;strong&gt;Boarding Ring technique&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equality&lt;/strong&gt; is the most treasurable property of the &lt;strong&gt;internet&lt;/strong&gt;. It ensures freedom and unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fear the villains will take advantage to spread &lt;strong&gt;crimes&lt;/strong&gt; to unprecedented wide range of the society but on the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;hegemonism&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;despotism&lt;/strong&gt; find their way to the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous&lt;/strong&gt; is the protection that ensures &lt;strong&gt;equality&lt;/strong&gt; at first but now the &lt;strong&gt;thread&lt;/strong&gt; to the security of an &lt;strong&gt;opening&lt;/strong&gt; online society that augments the physical world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not be afraid and together, we will find and perfect the techniques to avoid such &lt;strong&gt;sociological scam&lt;/strong&gt;. Among these are differential privacy, blockchain, &lt;strong&gt;open source&lt;/strong&gt; spirit and humanity! We should rethink about &lt;strong&gt;anonymity&lt;/strong&gt;, which is getting outdated in the &lt;strong&gt;flatting world&lt;/strong&gt; and only brings psychological attraction to behave out of box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach me out about building an identification system that should be passed to the next generations and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the subject has extensive research and applications done and ongoing. Many of these will start in lab and then be used in distance measurement (1-D), then be used in imaging (2-D) and ultimately space surveying (3-D). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no expert in any of the explicit topics but what I learned from physics is to think in first principle. That's how complexity collapses and technology reveals the nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do in astrophysics is just another aspect of the same principle. Except we have to use whatever we can and have to squeeze the information out. Because we don't have the energy for active measurement (shout and hear back) in such scale.  Data analysis in astronomy tries to utilize every pixel or even the dynamical photon counts (band and wavelets over the time in radio astronomy) to infer the source characteristics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continuous integration: test-driven and object-oriented for easier maintenances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;well documented: including report/web-page/presentation for better understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reproducibility: containerized developing environment, archived data and git-logged code repository should be accessible to replicate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;community driven: public ready to communicate on peer reviews and general feedbacks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Environment: Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docker-curriculum.com/"&gt;Containerize&lt;/a&gt;: balancing between system isolation and performance like a sandbox for &lt;em&gt;micro-service&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic concepts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images&lt;/em&gt; - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. In the demo above, we used the &lt;code&gt;docker pull&lt;/code&gt; command to download the &lt;strong&gt;busybox&lt;/strong&gt; image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Containers&lt;/em&gt; - Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; which we did using the busybox image that we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docker Daemon&lt;/em&gt; - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system to which clients talk to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docker Client&lt;/em&gt; - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as &lt;a href="https://kitematic.com/"&gt;Kitematic&lt;/a&gt; which provide a GUI to the users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/em&gt; - A &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore/"&gt;registry&lt;/a&gt; of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start from base image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic commands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;docker pull image_name  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pull public image/repository from a registry&lt;/span&gt;

docker build &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;--no-cache&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; -t image_name path/to/Dockerfile &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-f renamed-dockerfile&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

docker run -it  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# interactive&lt;/span&gt;
           --rm  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# rm container when exit&lt;/span&gt;
           -d  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# run as detached&lt;/span&gt;
           -p &lt;span class="m"&gt;8888&lt;/span&gt;:8888  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# port fwd to host&lt;/span&gt;
           -e &lt;span class="nv"&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$DISPLAY&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# set environment variable&lt;/span&gt;
           -u user  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# username/uid in image&lt;/span&gt;
           -v path/to/local:path/to/container  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# mount directory&lt;/span&gt;
           image_name
           &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;command&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

docker port container_id  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# show the open ports of a container instance&lt;/span&gt;
docker start/attach/stop/rm container_id  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# manage a container instance&lt;/span&gt;
docker rmi image_id  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# remove an image&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;public registry&lt;/a&gt;: be caution about potential security risk in 3rd party image/repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Record needed ingredients in requirement.txt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While developing, record the additional python packages in a text file named &lt;code&gt;requirement.txt&lt;/code&gt;, which will be useful to &lt;a href="#dockerfile"&gt;construct the &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to automatically configure the developing environment, as well as &lt;a href="#mybinder"&gt;hosting an interactive Jupyter notebook&lt;/a&gt; with mybinder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format"&gt;file format&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers"&gt;specifiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip freeze &amp;gt; requirement.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: list installed package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Example requirement.txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeProject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeProject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeProject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.2.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;SomeProject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;~=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.4.2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="dockerfile"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Compose building recipe to Dockerfile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/"&gt;Best practices&lt;/a&gt;: use minimum system with necessary packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/samples/"&gt;Base app samples&lt;/a&gt;: from IDE to OS, official docker images to start with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;: Community hub, use with caution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with a base image that meets the need of the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customize with additional dependency using &lt;code&gt;RUN sudo pip install -r requirement.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add special system setup and port configuration as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prototyping: Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some principles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented programing&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;function -&amp;gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;variable -&amp;gt; attribute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computational thinking: see the full image &lt;a href="/images/Methodology_DS_blue.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;img alt="" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d4jk8tso9vc9bjj/Screenshot%202018-08-14%2020.18.33.png?dl=1"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few suggestions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think about goals of code &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break into reasonable classes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pseudocode it up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check for efficient algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test each function and class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assemble code in &lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimize if necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Styling: &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;PEP8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;indentation: 4 spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;snake_case: packages, modules, functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CamelCase: classes, attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;alltogether: variables, add &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; for build-in variables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;space near operators, except for &lt;code&gt;func(a=1, b=3)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;c = a/b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate imports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;2 space # 1 space&lt;/code&gt; inline comments, docstring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;break liner &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Dev with Jupyter, note issues&lt;/strong&gt;: interactive notebook is very handy at development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="(http://dongming.uta.cloud/pdfs/LSST18.slides.html#/5)"&gt;Pitfall with interactive notebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;execution order matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory consuming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my LSST talk about &lt;a href="http://lsst.domij.info/"&gt;Jupyter as a Research Tool&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Aggregate to python script&lt;/strong&gt;: modularize codes into functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to read and adopt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/"&gt;Python Community Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html"&gt;Google Python Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test-driven design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modular code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specific and fine-grained test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regression test for bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Checkpoint scripts with git&lt;/strong&gt;: git log the progress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf"&gt;Github git cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt;: some basic operations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a private git repository on any ssh server with 6 lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# on server&lt;/span&gt;
mkdir project.git
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; project.git
git --bare init

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# client side&lt;/span&gt;
git init
git remote add mygitserver ssh://git@remote-host&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;:port&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;/path/to/project.git
git push mygitserver master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Packaging: iPython&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the code is ready to share,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a parent directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/introduction.html#distutils-simple-example"&gt;setup script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html"&gt;MANIFEST.in&lt;/a&gt; for list of files&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include README&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include LICENSE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include setup.py&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recursive-include folders scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;python setup.py sdist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Modularize function&lt;/strong&gt;: if not done earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;CamelCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# initialize&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__repr__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# print &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;program&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Unittest&lt;/strong&gt;: remember the issues we note down during the developing? These are good cases to write up tests about. A more proactive concept is test-driven programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;├── __init__.py
├── code.py
├── func_a.py
├── func_b.py
├── func_c.py
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_funcs.py
    └── test_something.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pytest&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conda install &lt;code&gt;pytest pytest-cov&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compose tests under &lt;code&gt;tests/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Continuous Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: use continuous integration to automatically test when something changes in repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis: require &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;circleci&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AppVeyor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# example .travis.yml file&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;3.6&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# command to install dependencies&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pip install -r requirement.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# command to run tests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Profiling &amp;amp; Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premature optimization is the root of all evil. -- Donald Knuth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;computation amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;input/output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tips from Cameron Hummels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what you are optimizing over &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer time versus person time &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write readable code first, then optimize &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use profilers to identify bottlenecks &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address bottlenecks one at a time &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest Python is most optimized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try new approaches and profile/testit &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object oriented code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NumPy arrarys are optimized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vectorize loops when possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List comprehensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid building lists through appends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In place operations as opposed to rebuilding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cython&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# coarse total time&lt;/span&gt;
%%timeit  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# code snippets&lt;/span&gt;
cProfile  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# deep profiling with viz tools&lt;/span&gt;
  pstats  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# text-based&lt;/span&gt;
  snakeviz
  runsnakerun  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# pipeline tool&lt;/span&gt;
  pyprof2html  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# html tool&lt;/span&gt;
line_profiler/kernprof  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# line-by-line function&lt;/span&gt;
memory_profiler  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# memory consumption and memory leaks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallel computing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multithreaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPI and mpi4py&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Documenting&lt;/strong&gt;: essential for future revisit or further development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versioning: x.y.z (E.g., 0.2.3, 2.7.12, 3.6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• change x for breaking changes
• change y for non-breaking changes
• change z for bug-fixes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;docstring and comments tips&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document while coding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;document the interfaces of modular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use descriptive names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consistent style/format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;docstring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following my WorkFlow, most of the work has been done at this stage. The rest can be carried out in very minimum effort with decent finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example finish: use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; for keyboard shortcuts to control the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dongming.uta.cloud/pdfs/report.html"&gt;Jupyter notebook to html report&lt;/a&gt;: my Ph.D. project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dongming.uta.cloud/pdfs/LSST18.slides.html#/"&gt;Jupyter notebook to html slides&lt;/a&gt;: my talk slides on LSST 2018 workshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://dongming.uta.cloud/pdfs/WorkFlow.html#/title-slide"&gt;MindNode to markdown to html slides&lt;/a&gt;: my draft slides of this document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. MindNote -&amp;gt; Markdown&lt;/strong&gt;: re-arrange and convert the outline mind map to markdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://mindnode.com/content/4-news/20170606-2017-06-06-introducing-ulysses/screen-capture-mindnode-export.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: Jupyter notebook should be re-organized for presentation, especially dissertation defense! The order of work is not necessary the order of talk! Check my &lt;a href="http://dongming.uta.cloud/pdfs/LSST18.slides.html#/11/1"&gt;LSST talk&lt;/a&gt; for some tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Markdown -&amp;gt; HTML&lt;/strong&gt;: extend the details in markdown and convert to html.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;: powerful tool for conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install: &lt;code&gt;brew install pandoc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; for frontpage info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/demos.html"&gt;usage demo&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;pandoc -s --mathjax -i -t --slide-level=2 revealjs WorkFlow.md -o WorkFlow.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Slideshow: HTML + reveal.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;-V revealjs-url=http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js&lt;/code&gt; when using pandoc to convert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or download &lt;a href="https://revealjs.com/#/"&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt; to the same directory of the converted directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's ready to open the html file to start the slideshow, use &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; for keyboard shortcuts to control the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workshop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take the research/project to a workshop, we need to recall what we've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Config env.: Dockerfile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything done, it is now easy to put all the ingredients and recipe together into a Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Example Dockerfile for python&lt;/span&gt;
cat &amp;gt; Dockerfile &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;FROM python:3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;WORKDIR /usr/src/app&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY requirements.txt ./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;COPY . .&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;CMD [ &amp;quot;python&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;./your-daemon-or-script.py&amp;quot; ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# build&lt;/span&gt;
docker build -t pydev .
docker run -it --rm pydev
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Demo: Markdown + Scripts -&amp;gt; Jupyter notebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the mind map and resulting markdown file, we can put the outline structure in Jupyter notebook since it natively supports markdown formatted cells. We can fill in the function calls and visualization codes in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My secret on toggling code cells&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nbextension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;codefolding&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;$ jupyter nbextension enable codefolding/main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more &lt;a href="https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions"&gt;extenstions&lt;/a&gt;: spellchecker, Table of Contents, Autoscroll,...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nbconvert&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;--template template.tpl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hide/remove code in one step &lt;a href="http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/hide-the-input-cells-from-your-ipython-slides.html"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more functionality available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another wheel to edit slide styles on the fly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/usage.html#"&gt;RISE&lt;/a&gt;: good for dev./workshop&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/parmentelat/RISE.git/doc2?filepath=examples%2FREADME.ipynb"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt;: interactive live rendering, based on reveal.js&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reveal.js: good for prod./presentation&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post-process with nbconvert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Slideshow: nbconvert + reveal.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrap up commands to convert notebook into slideshow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides --reveal-prefix reveal.js &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;--template hidecode/rmcode.tpl&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

wget https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/archive/3.6.0.tar.gz &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; tar -xvzf -

open notebook.slides.html
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repository: GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it is ready to take the project to the public, there are a few wheels very handy to make it more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live slideshow&lt;/strong&gt;: add some markup in the url of the html file in repository to render the slideshow in live, not always working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tammor.github.io/bs_page/2017/06/14/pandoc_to_reveal.html"&gt;reveal html files&lt;/a&gt;: go to &lt;code&gt;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;git_html_url&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;?print-pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live notebook demo: binder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is ready, just paste the repository link to mybinder.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#preparing-a-repository-for-binder"&gt;configure&lt;/a&gt;: add requirement.txt or Dockerfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;launch on &lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/"&gt;binder&lt;/a&gt;: recall the RISE demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"&gt;static option&lt;/a&gt;: open &lt;code&gt;http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/&lt;/code&gt; and paste the github url of the ipynb file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project webpage: github.io + HTML&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;github.io&lt;/a&gt;: use any of the converted html file to set it up in 3 steps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a repository with &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add HTML file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to &lt;code&gt;https://username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation: Read the Docs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step depends on how often and well the project is documented. If earlier guide is followed, there is no pain at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sphinx with &lt;a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html"&gt;reST&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;sphinx-quickstart -a "Name" -p Repo -v 0.1 --ext-autodoc -q&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doxygen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;readthedocs: link github &amp;amp; auto build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building test: Travis CI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the manual/documentation! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\eta\)&lt;/span&gt;: apply learning rate schedules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saddle points as local minimum: spiking NN for quantum tunneling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvements for SDG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;add momentum:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v_t = \gamma v_t - 1 + \eta \cdot \nabla_\theta J(\theta); \theta = \theta -v_t\)&lt;/span&gt;, reduce damping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAG, Nesterov accelerated gradient: add correction based on momentum, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(J(\theta) -&amp;gt; J(\theta - \gamma v_t - 1)\)&lt;/span&gt;, avoid momentum crash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adagrad, adaptive gradient: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\eta_i\)&lt;/span&gt; for each &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_i\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\theta_{t+1}=\theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{G_t+\epsilon}}\odot g_t\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adadelta: reduce the calculation of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(G_t\)&lt;/span&gt; with a window-based average, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E_t\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RMSprop: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E_t = \gamma E_{t-1} + (1-\gamma)g_t^2\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam, adaptive moment estimation: bias-corrected from weighted average mean and variance

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra to explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shuffling and Curriculum Learning &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batch normalization: keep N(0,1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early stopping: avoid overfitting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradient noise: shuffle away from local&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Activation Function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back-propagatable, non-linear projection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;keep nonlinearity &amp;amp; non-vanishing gradient&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sigmoid: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, work with cross-entropy cost function &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\ln{a}+(1-y)\ln{(1-a)}\)&lt;/span&gt; to avoid gradient vanishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tanh, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(tanh(x)= 2 \sigmoid(2x)-1\)&lt;/span&gt;: better but not the final solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ReLU, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=x\ge0? x:0\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constant gradient on one side&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ReLU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PReLU/MPELU with &lt;a href="https://blog.csdn.net/zouxy09/article/details/24971995"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;regularizer&lt;/strong&gt;/penalty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regularization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;minimize the loss function with reasonable complexity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervised learning: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w^* = \arg\min_w \sum_i L(y_i, f(x_i;w)) + \lambda \Omega(w)\)&lt;/span&gt;, solve ill-conditioned matrix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L0/L1, minimize the absolute sum: Lasso regularization, make &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(w\)&lt;/span&gt; sparse, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(||w||_1 \le C\)&lt;/span&gt;, linear bound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature Selection: less feature needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpretability: less complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;less features &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L2, minimize the square sum: Ridge Regression/Weight Decay, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(||w||_2 \le C\)&lt;/span&gt;, quadratic bound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;won't reduce features&lt;br&gt;
but reduce certain feature dependence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tuning Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the evil approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denoising Autoencoders: obtain good representation&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perform noise mapping: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \rightarrow \tilde{ x}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep loss as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{L}(x,\tilde{x'})\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restricted Boltzmann Machine: unsupervised learning&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generative approach: obtain &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(X,Y)\)&lt;/span&gt; for P(Y|X); in contrast of discriminative approach, which only cares about &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Y|X)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;methods: Markov process &amp;amp; Gibbs sampling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metrics: KL divergence, Shannon entropy, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sum_i P(i)\log\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probability distribution: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P = \frac{1}{Z}e^{-E(v,h)}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy function: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(E(v,h) =-v^T Wh -a^Tv -b^Th\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(v\)&lt;/span&gt; visible unit, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(h\)&lt;/span&gt; hidden unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spiking Neural Network (3rd generation)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiking neuron: accumulate their activation into a potential over time, and only send out a signal (a "spike") when this potential crosses a threshold and the neuron is reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images&lt;/em&gt; - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. In the demo above, we used the &lt;code&gt;docker pull&lt;/code&gt; command to download the &lt;strong&gt;busybox&lt;/strong&gt; image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Containers&lt;/em&gt; - Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; which we did using the busybox image that we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docker Daemon&lt;/em&gt; - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system to which clients talk to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docker Client&lt;/em&gt; - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as &lt;a href="https://kitematic.com/"&gt;Kitematic&lt;/a&gt; which provide a GUI to the users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/em&gt; - A &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore/"&gt;registry&lt;/a&gt; of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my Ph.D. study, I've been questioning about, what is re-search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that research is about &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looking at something, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;over and over, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in all possible aspects.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;narrow assumptions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply different methods,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and learn …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Graduate Study in a Glance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;collect more data,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and learn new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reproducibility =&amp;gt; why I present in this transparent way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so it is informative about what I conclude and how I deliver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, I studied about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Globular Clusters, these are&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stellar systems that consist of millions of stars, they are also&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ancient building blocks of galaxies themselves. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are extremely interesting environments, in a sense that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the timescale of stellar evolution, becomes comparable to &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the timescale to have stellar encounters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the stars in these dense star clusters don't die alone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they will influence the nearby-stars over dynamical interactions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;their own stellar evolutions are also altered during such processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;smaller systems like open clusters cannot stay gravitationally-binded&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stars are easily scattered away and they will evaporate before long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are also enough materials to power multiple generation of star formations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;larger systems like galaxies instead, have strong gravitational potentials&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the stars are trapped and move under a quasi-static field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the system could be described as statistical equilibrium,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from that, I learned about &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the larger structure in the local universe and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;built up the concept of the cosmic web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will expand on that by populating globular clusters in the local universe, which is the second chapter in my dissertation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I had this chance to study about numerical simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent the 2013 summer in National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Science to study about N-body models with &lt;a href="http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/faculty/rainer-spurzem"&gt;Rainer Spurzem&lt;/a&gt;, using Newtonian integrator to solve dynamical interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also [met with Jonathon Downing and] picked up the Monte Carlo code from &lt;a href="https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/people/staff/mig/"&gt;Mirek Giersz&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the phase-space evolution in a semi-equilibrium system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both approaches provide great details about stellar dynamics based on theoretical assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the formation mechanism of compact binary systems,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to the observable global effects of the star clusters, 
different physics and phenomenons are implemented in various scale. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaption of &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these numerical methods, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in together with high performance computing techniques, 
push forward the research greatly so that theoretical prospects become &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;essential to new proposed instrumental projects,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instructional to reveal discoveries buried in observed data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed such aspects in the history of GC studies in chapter 3 and introduced my own simulations to represent the natural assembling of GCs in chapter 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major effects considered in GCs and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the detailed modeling 
are discussed in my dissertation in corresponding sections. I will only briefly demonstrate the key components later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those simulations, I could extract any interesting stellar object with its full dynamical history, especially the compact binary systems that could be potentially the gravitational wave sources in different frequency domain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent 2015 summer at Kavli Institute of Astrophysics and Astronomy in Peking University doing data analysis by querying observational databases for variable sources, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I visited National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Science again to prototype a transient object detection pipeline for 50cm Binocular Network with &lt;a href="http://sourcedb.naoc.cas.cn/en/enaoexpert/200907/t20090706_2000374.html"&gt;Licai Deng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/faculty/richard-de-grijs"&gt;Richard de Grijs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual benefits supplemented my experience in optical data processing that promoted my understanding on time series data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sketched the work flow to estimate the local abundance of GCs in chapter 2. At the same time, I started to focus on the binary black holes for the resulting GW signals. Matt's code based on Peter's work about general relativity was parallelized to carry out the relativistic evolution for the compact binary systems extracted from GCs. A brief introduction about BBH formation mechanisms and GW astronomy could be found in chapter 5. At the time of the first GW detection, my preliminary result presented on MODEST meeting ruled out GC as the origin of the IMBH merger event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 summer, I started training in the LSST data science program and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the systematic coverage of statistical background &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and conventional data analysis tools 
enhanced my modeling of the GC populations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the super-cluster in Texas Advanced Computing Center, my collection of GC simulations was also enlarged greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More realizations of the same setup were added to make sure the convergence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finer-grained parameter space was explored to avoid extremity. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selection effect and sampling bias had been made aware as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all the above, a clear image appeared &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to derive the detection prospects of BBHs, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which are dynamically formed in GCs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;within 30 Mpc volumetric space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for space-borne GW detectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fixer Informative Matrix analysis from Cutler and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configured the BBH database to work with Matt's code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of work is included in chapter 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, I will walk through the work manuscript-ed in my dissertation in brief and let you question about any part that is particular interesting to your extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt; Create RDDs
  * HadoopRDD: &lt;code&gt;val lines = sc.textFile("hdfs://names")&lt;/code&gt;
  * MapPartitionsRDD: &lt;code&gt;val kvp = lines.map(name =&amp;gt; (name(0), name))&lt;/code&gt;
  * ShuffledRDD: &lt;code&gt;val groups = kvp.groupByKey()&lt;/code&gt;
  * MapPartitionsRDD: &lt;code&gt;val res = groups.mapvalues(names =&amp;gt; names.toSet.size)&lt;/code&gt;
  * collect()
&lt;/em&gt; RDD Dependency
  * Narrow: One To One
  * Shuffle Dependency: 
&lt;em&gt; DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) Generation
  * stage 0: HadoopRDD, MapPartitionsRDD
  * stage 1: ShuffledRDD, MapPartitionsRDD
&lt;/em&gt; Schedule Tasks
  * split each stage into tasks based on partition
  * reversed order, recursively find parent stages
  * blocking between stages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;delay scheduling  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spark.locality.wait (default 3s)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reserved: 300MB, default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Memory: 25%, user data structure in RDD (value/variable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution: internal storage, shuffle buffer on the mapper&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;export &lt;code&gt;SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY 96G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage: cache, dynamic, default 0.5 of 75%&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;spark.memory.storageFraction&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;conf/spark-defaults.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase parallelism&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more reducers by setting &lt;code&gt;spark.default.parallelism&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set number of partitions of the largest parent RDD &lt;code&gt;sc.textFile(path,128)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YARN: use flag &lt;code&gt;--executor-memory 2g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/mpi-send-and-receive/"&gt;send &amp;amp; recv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;communication across nodes is x100 slower than within nodes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blocking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;send &amp;amp; recv are blocking operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deadlock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;receive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;might work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;receive&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Bypass blocking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;odds &amp;amp; evens: exchange sort, compare-and-swap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pairwise exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Non-blocking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;isend, irecv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;need &lt;code&gt;MPI_Wait&lt;/code&gt; as blocking to refresh the buffer; buffer is safe in blocking comm.
&lt;code&gt;Latency hiding&lt;/code&gt;: don't need to hold until comm is done
&lt;code&gt;TEST&lt;/code&gt;: non-blacking wait, do local work if no incoming msg by test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPI_Bsend, MPI_Ibsend: buffered send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPI_Ssend, MPI_Issend: synchronous send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPI_Rsend, MPI_Irsend: ready send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-sided communication: ‘just’ put/get the data somewhere &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derived data types: send strided/irregular/inhomogeneous data &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sub-communicators: work with subsets of MPI_COMM_WORLD &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I/O: efficient file operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-blocking collectives&lt;/li&gt;
